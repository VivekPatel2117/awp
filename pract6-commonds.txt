Process: A process is an instance of a running program that includes the program code and its current activity. Each process has its own memory space and resources.

Shell Process: This refers to processes that are initiated by a shell, such as Bash. When you execute a command in the shell, it creates a new process for that command.

Process Commands: These are commands used to manage and interact with processes in the system. Common commands include ps, top, kill, and bg.

ps: The ps command displays information about active processes. By default, it shows processes running in the current shell.

Example: ps displays a list of processes for the current user.

Options:

(ps -e): Displays all processes running on the system.
(ps -f): Shows processes in a full format, including PPID and start time.
(ps aux): Lists all running processes with detailed information, including CPU and memory usage.
Utilities related to ps commands:

(top): Provides a dynamic view of running processes, updating in real time.
Example: top shows a list of processes sorted by CPU usage.
(htop): An interactive process viewer that is more user-friendly than top.
Example: htop allows you to sort and manage processes using keyboard shortcuts.
(pstree): Displays running processes in a tree format, showing parent-child relationships.
Example: pstree presents a visual hierarchy of all processes.
