Disk Utilities: Tools used to manage disk space, file systems, and storage devices. They help users monitor and manipulate disk usage.

df: Displays the amount of disk space used and available on file systems.

Example: df -h shows disk usage in human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB).
du: Displays disk usage for files and directories, showing how much space they occupy.

Example: du -sh /path/to/directory gives the total size of the specified directory.
mount: Attaches a file system to a directory, making it accessible.

Example: mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt mounts the device sdb1 at the /mnt directory.
unmount: Detaches a mounted file system, making it no longer accessible.

Example: umount /mnt unmounts the file system mounted at /mnt.
find: Searches for files and directories in a specified path based on various criteria.

Example: find /path/to/search -name "*.txt" finds all .txt files in the specified directory.
unmask: Sets or displays the default file permission mask for new files and directories.

Example: umask 022 sets the default permissions to 755 for directories and 644 for files.
unlink: Removes a single file without using rm. It does not work on directories.

Example: unlink filename.txt deletes filename.txt.
